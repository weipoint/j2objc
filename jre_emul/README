This package contains the Java and Objective-C source files to build the JRE
emulation library for J2ObjC.  The Objective-C sources are all in the Classes
directory, like most Xcode projects.  All Objective-C sources were created for
this project.

Java source files come from four sources:

* Apache Harmony Project: these files are rooted in the apache_harmony
  directory, and have the same directory structure as that project.  Some of
  these files have been modified for use by this project, including some that
  have Objective-C native code.

* Google Web Toolkit (GWT): these are in the Classes directory, with their
  packages as their directories (ie, java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException
  is in Classes/java/util/regex/PatternSyntaxException.java).  GWT sources
  were sometimes preferred over Apache Harmony Project versions if they had
  an implementation that had reduced dependencies on other sources, to keep
  mobile client code compact.

* Android Open Source: these are in the Classes directory, like GWT.  In
  general, we only included Android source files when they were not
  implemented by the Apache Harmony Project, mostly new classes from Java 6.

* Created for this project: also in the Classes directory.

The reason the Apache Harmony Project's files are separate is simple: give 
credit where it's due.  The GWT, Android, and J2ObjC sources are all from
Google, and the Apache Harmony team is a separate, equally respected team.
We appreciate the hard work that went into all these projects.

Finally, there are some files in Classes that look like Java classes, but
have Objective-C suffixes.  These are drop-in replacements for translated
classes; for example, Classes/java/util/HashMap.h (and .m) defines a faster
implementation than its translated code equivalent.
