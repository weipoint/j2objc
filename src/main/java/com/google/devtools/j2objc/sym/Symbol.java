 * Base class for program symbols.  A symbol at a minimum consists of a name,
 * a binding (type) and a scope.  One difference between symbols and JDT
 * bindings is that only declaration bindings are used, not separate
 * references to declarations.  This makes it easier to do global changes,
 * such as changing names and adding method parameters.
